If you're using a (Sass built) CSS framework like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/sass.html), [Sierra CSS](https://sierra-library.github.io/), etc. if you've applied the color vars for your scheme, you can start setting variables:

## Bootstrap 

## Foundation

## Sierra
