## Purpose

I was working on creating a new Jekyll theme for my Github pages site.  I started following the rabbit hole that is the internet while I was looking up how to style the Jekyll highlight blocks, after following that trail a little I came across the (Base16 project)[http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/] and decided it was the one.

There are a number of sites with mismatched versions of different Rouge higlight css files.  These were good starters for the original theme I had been using, but as my new project was being built on SCSS I wanted to include a way to cusotmize using the available tools.  

**Rouge Base16 SCSS** was born.
